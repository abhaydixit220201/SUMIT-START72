Bob received an assignment from his school: he has two numbers  � A and  � B, and he has to find the sum of these two numbers. Alice, being a good friend of Bob, told him that the answer to this question is  � C. Bob doesn't completely trust Alice and asked you to tell him if the answer given by Alice is correct or not.
